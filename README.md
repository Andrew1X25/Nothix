# Nothix

## 🚀 Project Overview

Nothix is an initiative focused on developing a comprehensive platform for **business process automation, data analysis, and administrative reporting**. Our goal is to leverage powerful, flexible workflow tools (like n8n) to streamline operations, automate critical communication channels (especially email), and provide key insights through a centralized web dashboard.

We aim to create a reliable system that acts as a **data collector and analyzer** for business efficiency.

## ✨ Key Features & Proposed Workflows

The platform is designed to automate and manage complex tasks, turning raw business data into actionable information:

* **Intelligent Email Automation:** Implementation of a core workflow where incoming emails are processed by an AI, a response draft is created, and the user receives a message for approval before the email is sent.
* **Centralized Administrative Dashboard:** A custom web interface designed for a clear and functional user experience (planned as a **funnel page** with a login/registration leading to the dashboard).
* **Custom Reporting & Analytics:** The dashboard will feature custom reports to provide key metrics and information, such as:
    * Weekly email summaries and reply status (answered vs. unanswered).
    * Overview of remaining and completed tasks.
* **Marketing Integration:** Connecting the system with external platforms, such as Facebook, to ensure unified data flow.
